<h1 align="center"> Table detection modules </h1>
These table detection modules can be used to detect tables in various kinds of document such invoices, scientific paper and many more. We will be making commit in each of these folder as they grow. Lastly we will create framework where each of models can be called directly from one script.

## Model Tested
1. YOLO
2. DETR
3. CascadeTabNet

## Training Dataset
Doclaynet - a human-annotated document layout segmentation dataset containing 80863 pages from a broad variety of document sources was used to train and test.
Models were regressively tested on complex medical data (proprietary data) as well.
